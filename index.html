					<h4 class="my-3">What it does</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">EcoRoad is an environmental energy converting system in which make use of the heat from the road to generate electricity.</p>
					
					<h4 class="my-3">Where would it be placed</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">This device will be placed on the roads for the best efficiency as roads can go up to 60°C on a hot sunny day. This system can be implemented on anywhere that has roads, but we are targeting to start with roads in parks and slowly expand our system to around HDB and then CBD areas</p>
					
					<h4 class="my-3">How it works</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">We are using a device called peltiers to convert our heat energy into electrical energy. Peltiers need a hot side and a cool side for it to be able to generate electricity. The hot side is captured from the roads and he cool side is achieved from the air. We plan to tap the electricity into the national grid line so that the electricity can be used nationwide to power uses needs.</p>
					
					<h4 class="my-3">Why EcoRoad?</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">We have decided to create this system because, in Singapore we don't have space to make solar farms, hydropower farms, and windmill farms. We are targeting roads because in Singapore, 12% of the land are used for roads which is equivalent to a total of 13,483 Soccer Fields. Plus, roads are only going to get more in the future. Just imagine how much electricity we could potentially produce especially when roads in singapore heat up to about 60 degrees celcius</p>

					<h4 class="my-3">What it does</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">EcoTile is an environmentally friendly product that produces energy by making use of heat from the sun and flowing water in buildings to convert to electricity</p>
					
					<h4 class="my-3">Where would it be placed</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">This device is placed preferably on building rooftops, where water pipes from the building are readily available and the device is recieves the most heat from the sun. This is to make sure that the water from the building has an easier path to go through this device first before being provided to the consumer. </p>
					
					<h4 class="my-3">How it works</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">We are using a device called Peltiers or also known as a thermoelectric generator. In order to generate electricity using this device, we need a temperature difference to be applied on the Peltier(a hot side and a cool side) To get the "hot side", EcoTile will capture the heat from the sun and to get the "cool side", water supplies from the building would go through EcoTile first before reaching the consumer. This means that whenever someone from the building uses water to wash their hands, take a shower, etc. Water would flow though EcoTile providing the device with the cooling needed for it to generate electricity</p>
					
					<h4 class="my-3">Why EcoTile?</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">We wanted Singapore to progress to becoming a smart nation and one of the ways is to go green, however, how could we go green when space is very limited here? Therefore, EcoTile is borned! This device does not take up valuable space as it is reusing the space that has already been used which is rooftops! In fact, even if the rooftops has solar panels installed, EcoTile could still be implemented alongside with the solar panels because solar panels uses light while EcoTile uses heat!</p>

					<h4 class="my-3">What it does</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">EcoFloat is another type of energy converting system which also uses heat to generate electricity however unlike EcoRoad, it does not use a fan to cool the heat sink but uses flowing water underneath the modules. </p>
					
					<h4 class="my-3">Where would it be placed</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">Due to Singapore's lack of space, This device is ment to be floating on large body of water such as reservoir, canals and sea. The flowing water underneath the device would provide the cooling needed for the device to work efficiently. </p>
					
					<h4 class="my-3">How it works</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">It generate electricity through the device called Peltier which are also known as thermoelectric generator (TEG). Peltiers will need a temperature difference, a cool side and a hot side, to generate electricity. The hot side is achieved through the heat from the Sun and the cool side is achieved from the heat sink that is contact with the flowing water.</p>
					
					<h4 class="my-3">Why EcoFloat?</h4>
					<p class="text-muted">We have decided to create this system because, it will come at some point where we can no longer be using the lands as it is slowly being occupied. Alternative method will be using the vast space on the sea which takes up 71% of the Earth's surface. Some solar panels are also being placed on top of the sea and our product can work along side with the solar panel too. Solar panel will be heated up over the long period of being exposed to the Sun and our product will be able to make use of the heat trap in the solar panel to further generate more electricity.</p>
